In these pipelines, we begin by converting DHM (Digital Holographic Microscopy) and Mask images to 8-bit grayscale format, ensuring compatibility with the U-Net structure. This conversion allows us to represent the image intensities within a dynamic range of 0 to 255. Additionally, the pipelines include an image expansion step, employing the random crop and rotation method. These techniques generate image patches with a fixed size of 128 by 128 pixels. By applying this expansion process, we can enhance the diversity of the training data, thereby improving the robustness and generalization of our model.
